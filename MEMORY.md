## ▶ Live resume state

- ✅ **Bundle A shipped.** Per-directory switching (Bundle B) was never built. It was parked on 2026-09-27 because both profiles are run from the same directory.
- ✅ **Synced with upstream v0.2.0 on 2026-09-29.** The fork ported the two upstream fixes it lacked, `2308675` (seeding skips transcripts, plans and usage accounting) and `1ba8402` (refresh warns that history will be deleted), along with the 0.2.0 version bump. Upstream's `main` was then recorded as merged with `-s ours`, because the rest of it is this fork's PRs #1–#4 in a different shape.
- **If Bundle B is revived:** use a launch-time `claude` shell wrapper, a global `~/.claude-switch/routes.json` with longest-prefix matching, and let unrouted folders fall through to plain `claude`.
- ✅ **Skills sync shipped 2026-09-27.** `cswitch sync` links the shared user-level skills into every profile, and `cswitch use` syncs before it launches. Settings sync is parked.
- ✅ **Plan-limit bars shipped 2026-09-29.** `cswitch list`, `cswitch info` and the TUI detail panel show the 5-hour and 7-day windows from Claude Code's own cached snapshot in each profile's `.claude.json`. They read it offline and never write it, and they always print the snapshot's age. A window whose reset time has passed shows `reset`, and a snapshot that belongs to another account is hidden.
- **Next:** the token ledger, `cswitch usage`. It will total tokens and cost per profile and per project, read offline from the transcripts into an incremental, deduplicated ledger.
